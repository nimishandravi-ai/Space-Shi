SPACE-SHI

-> This is a game on the theme of cosmic adventures, but guess what? You're in a war. Yes, a war. Some context: 
- Our beautiful planet, Earth was invaded by the Empire, a faction spanning multiple solar systems whose only goal is profit, regardless of the cost.
- To combat this, the Union was established, a collection of all the world's nations whose sole purpose was combatting the extraterrestrial threat.

-> A little context about the missions:
- You were put in a spaceship and sent off to counter the attack, you have two alliy ships that support you.
- After successfully countering the ruthless attack, you are sent off on a reconnaissance mission that aims to find the location of the enemy Overlord.
- You are sent off to the Overlord's planet, its going to be an unforgiving fight... Oh and the overlord is not what he seems like.

-> The controls of the game are as follows:
- Press A and D to move left and right, the arrow keys do nothing.
- LMB(Left Mouse Button) to fire at the position aimed at by your cursor.
- In the last mission, you have the freedom to move up and down upto a certain limit.
